# hw-coderefactor

## This is the CODE REFACTOR homework for bootcamp 

Horiseon website is a single site that lists the services that the company offers. 

The site code itself required some cleaning up in the html and css files and edited for best practices. 

Things that were updated include.
1. Removing <div> tags and create distinct sections that would be easier for future developers to work off of.
2. Adding alt tags to all images.
3. Updating the stylesheet to include distinct sections as well as consolidating some of the styles
3. Making sure that with these changes, the site is still functional.
